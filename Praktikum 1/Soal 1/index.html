    <p style="text-align:center;color:black;font-family:consolas;font-size:18px"><b>We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
        But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes. <br>
        One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, <br>
        Yet the plural of moose should never be meese. <br>
        You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
        Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice. <br></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:black;font-family:consolas;font-size:15px">
       If the plural of man is always called men, <br>
        Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen? <br>
        If I speak of my foot and show you my feet, <br>
        And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? <br>
        If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
        Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth? <br></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:black;font-family:consolas;font-size:12px">
       Then one may be that, and three would be those, <br>
        Yet hat in the plural would never be hose, <br>
        And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br> 
        We speak of a brother and also of brethren, <br>
        But though we say mother, we never say methren. <br>
        Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, <br>
        <strike>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</strike></b></p>
